Repo for the course Deep Learning, DiploDatos2020

Multilayer Perceptron Applications based on baseline model developed by [crscardellino](https://github.com/DiploDatos/AprendizajeProfundo.git) 

In this repo MLP models different models, with different hyperparameters, are run and their accuracy evaluated. The [pdf](https://github.com/zarfer007/AprendizajeProfundo_Lab_MLP/blob/main/Deep_Learning.pdf) file seen above (or doing click in the link pdf) describes the findings. It also includes the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model presented in the [corresponding link repo](https://github.com/emiliomrb/AprendizajeProfundo)
